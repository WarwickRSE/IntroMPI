This Fortran uses something you may not have seen commonly, namely the
preprocessor. To exclude the User-interface we set the
variable NODISPLAY variable when compiling. So we do something like

mpif90 -DNODISPLAY parallel.F90 -o parallel

Notice that the file is now named with a capital F. This can be used to mean
"Run the preprocessor on this file" on systems with Case-sensitive file systems.
